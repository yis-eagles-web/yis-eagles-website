                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">As Valentine’s Day approached, YIS buzzed with excitement. Hallways filled with laughter, eager speculation about what surprises lay ahead. This year, love, appreciation, and gratitude took a creative turn with Valograms! 
	At the start of February, the clubs Elemental and Cr82heal unveiled their special Valentine’s initiative: beautifully handcrafted bouquet deliveries. “What better way to show your love and appreciation than with a handmade Valogram bouquet for your friends, teachers, or someone special?” Said Scarlett, the president of Cr82heal. 
</p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">The sale featured three beautifully crafted bouquets, each with its own unique name and charm. Thoughtfully designed and handcrafted with care, these bouquets were the perfect way for anybody to express their appreciation, friendship, or love in a heartfelt and meaningful way. 
	Then, the long awaited moment arrived, February 14th! As bouquets found their recipients, smiles and surprises lit up faces across YIS! “I felt more appreciated and important to my friends! I felt very happy to receive these bouquets because I didn’t expect there to be more than one.” Shared Ruching, a Grade 9 student.
</p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">
	In the end, it wasn’t just about flowers, it was about the joy, appreciation, and connection they brought. A small gesture, yet a lasting impact. 

A huge thanks to Cr82heal and Elemental for organizing such a thoughtful and creative Valentine’s experience with Valograms.
