                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">Hey, Eagles! Don’t you think now is the time to enlighten yourself about climate change? Well, no worries because GREENIFY is currently hosting a “Plastic Drive” where participants throw plastic, aluminum, and paper wastes into bins hand-crafted by the members themselves! 
“Plastic Drive” is an environmental event led by the GREENIFY club at YIS. GREENIFY is aiming to raise awareness about excessive use of plastic waste and its consequences. After a year of observation and experience, the GREENIFY members have decided that they are going to take a step towards reducing plastic waste lying around within our school environment.
                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">This drive focuses on reducing, reusing, recycling, and upcycling plastic, paper, and aluminum waste within the school environment. The club has placed the cardboard boxes (bins) around the school as some of you may have noticed. You can put the trash (plastic, paper, and aluminum) you want to get rid of, in the boxes correlating to your grade level.
This “Plastic Drive” event aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 13 as well. GREENIFY believes that by relying on SDG Goal 13, we must take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts, or else the future generations—including ours—will suffer from the consequences.
                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">With your help, we can take another step towards combating plastic pollution. “Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.” GREENIFY is looking forward to hosting more events and activities to continue raising awareness about environmental conservation and climate change.
