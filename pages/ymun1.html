                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">On January 28th, the varsity basketball team kicked off the season with their first game against ISY. Even before the game began, the energy was high, with many coming to support the away game. As soon as the whistle blew, the game was fierce, with both the boys and girls giving their all, playing with determination and drive. As the game went on, both the boys and girls fought hard, aiming to keep a strong defense and secure baskets. No matter the challenge, the Eagles gave everything they had! 

By the end of the game, the girls celebrated their first victory of the season!

Khin, captain of the Girl’s Basketball Team says “The game with ISY went a lot better than I expected. Starting out the season later than every other school I thought that our team would have a lot to catch up to, so I was prepared to take a loss on this first game. But Su Latt and the underclassmen all exceeded my expectation and did extremely well, allowing us to get our first win. I’m satisfied and this is a great start to our season. I cannot wait to see what our team will grow into.”



                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">Although the boys may have not secured the win, they played well and showed great teamwork.

Mr. Jay, the coach of the Boy’s Basketball Team says “Our boys played with their heart, and that’s what truly matters. We knew we were up against a stronger, faster, and more experienced team, but that didn’t stop them from giving everything they had from start to finish. I’m incredibly proud of their effort, resilience, and sportsmanship.



                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">For me, success isn’t just about winning, it’s about applying what we’ve learned during the practice, playing with respect (teammates, opponents and officials), and growing as a team. And they did exactly that! This was a step forward, and I’m excited to see them keep improving.”

Now with the upcoming game against ILBC on Friday the 7th, let’s all support and show the Eagles spirit at our gym!”
