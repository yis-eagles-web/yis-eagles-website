                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">On the afternoon of January 31st, a delegation of YIS students arrived at the highly anticipated sixteenth Yangon Model United Nations (YMUN) conference, ready for three days of diplomacy, debate, and global collaboration! Held in ISY, the conference brought together students from ISM, ISY, MIS, MISY, YA, and YIS.
With 36 delegates, YIS is proud to have the highest number of delegates participating this year. The school community is also delighted for the 8 delegates who were recognized for their outstanding performances and received awards.

                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">
                    Five students from YIS participated in the conference as chairs. Out of the five, three students, Nyan Lin Ko @ Ted, Paing Soe Thar @ Peter, and Waddy Yun Eaindra Htun @ Eliza had the unique opportunity to chair committees for the first time in YMUN, with the exception of chairing in MY-YMUN.

                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">
                    One chair, Nyan Lin Ko @ Ted, said, "[YMUN] had a wide range of topics, from monkeys and bananas, to Saudi Arabia bribing countries with oil and nuking Iran. After all, YMUN XVI was the best conference for me so far!"

                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">
                    Throughout the conference, YIS students demonstrated their skills in diplomacy and negotiation. One minor challenge was the limited food option, as the meals were strictly vegetarian. YMUN XVI was an unforgettable experience, and the YIS delegation looks forward to future MUN conferences, ready to take on new challenges!
