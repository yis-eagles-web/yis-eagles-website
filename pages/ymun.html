                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">Get Ready for the YMUN Experience The Yangon Model United Nations (YMUN) is coming up on January 31st to Febuary2nd. It will be hosted at ISY and it’s an event you don't want to miss out on! Whether you’re a first-time delegate or someone
                    with years and years of YMUN experience, YMUN has something exciting to offer for everyone. It is more than a competition and debates; it is an opportunity to meet new people from different schools, learn new skills, and make many
                    memories that you can recall from your high school years! Now, you might be wondering what MUN conferences are. “MUN is a Model United Nations where people come together as a delegate of a country and solve an issue of what’s going
                    on in a country and what is needed, and we make resolutions on how it would be possible to make the world a better place” said Maranda, a sophomore at YIS. MUN conferences are one of the most well-known conferences in the world. It
                    is a conference for academic excellence and leadership.
                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">During the MUN conferences, high school students get to roleplay as delegates from other counties. They work together to solve and write resolutions for real world problems like climate change, human right issues and global health issues.
                    Students can discuss important topics, negotiate with other delegates, and create solutions in their own committees. MUN conferences are not just about speaking well and debating but also about listening, collaborating, and thinking
                    critically. The MUN conferences provide students with an understanding of the challenges our world faces and how great teamwork leads to great solutions. What makes YMUN special? YMUN isn't just about committee sessions. There is so
                    much more to explore during the conferences. You’ll hear from many people who are experts in different ways that will share their knowledge and inspire you to think and be better at debating. These YMUN conferences will also help you
                    build skills like public speaking, research, critical thinking and leadership. It also gives you a chance to meet students from many different schools in Yangon and gives you a broader perspective that you can't find in a classroom.
                    At the end of the conferences, you can also receive awards such as the best delegate, most diploaticand so on! Now, why should you participate in YMUN? The YMUN conferences are not just about focusing on winning awards but also focus
                    on growing as a person.
                </p>
                <p class="main" style="line-height:2; margin: 50px;">You’ll leave the conference with better communication skills, more confidence and a deeper understanding of issues around the world. It is also a great way to make friends who might have the same interests as you. For many students, YMUN
                    is a where their character developed in high school. It helps them see how they can make a difference through leadership, teamwork, or creative problem-solving. If you have ever thought of ways you can contribute to global challenges
                    or are interested in issues around the world, YMUN is a great way to start. To sum this all up, YMUN is more than just a conference, it's a chance to grow, learn, debate, and be inspired. Whether you’re solving problems in your committee,
                    making frenemies, or learning from the Chairs (student leaders of a committee that make sure that the committee's work is completed smoothly and successfully), you’ll walk away with new skill and amazing memories. Be prepared to count
                    the days until the conference and prepared for "”
